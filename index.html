          <p class="about"> My name is William Brady and I'm a wildcrafting practitioner dedicated to harvesting,
          in properly observed manners, spirit-calling medicines for others.
          These are sometimes known as “vestiges," which may maintain and restore balance(s) in their
          lives and those they care about.

          <br><br>Wildcrafting is the art of perpetual
          learning, observing, and harvesting from nature, requiring year-round commitment. One of the
          ways commitment to nature works best is by receiving Creation's help
          from the ancient practices, along with dedication to spirit work.

          <br><br>I'm based out of Southern California, and it’s been an honor to be entrusted and
          guided in this work since 1997.</p>
